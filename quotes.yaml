- :c: There's no test like production.

- :c: We better hurry up and start coding, there are going to be a lot of bugs to fix.

- :c: Mostly, when you see programmers, they aren't doing anything. One of the attractive things about programmers is that you cannot tell whether or not they are working simply by looking at them. Very often they're sitting there seemingly drinking coffee and gossiping, or just staring into space. What the programmer is trying to do is get a handle on all the individual and unrelated ideas that are scampering around in his head.

  :a: John Carmack

- :c: The idea that I can be presented with a problem, set out to logically solve it with the tools at hand, and wind up with a program that could not be legally used because someone else followed the same logical steps some years ago and filed for a patent on it is horrifying.

  :a: Nathaniel S Borenstein

- :c: In order to understand recursion, one must first understand recursion.

- :c: On two occasions I have been asked [by members of Parliament], 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?' I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.

- :c: Around computers it is difficult to find the correct unit of time to measure progress. Some cathedrals took a century to complete. Can you imagine the grandeur and scope of a program that would take as long?
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: For systems, the analogue of a face-lift is to add to the control graph an edge that creates a cycle, not just an additional node.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

   The eleventh commandment was "Thou Shalt Compute" or "Thou Shalt Not Compute" - I forget which.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: The string is a stark data structure and everywhere it is passed there is much duplication of process. It is a perfect vehicle for hiding information.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

   Everyone can be taught to sculpt: Michelangelo would have had to be taught not to. So it is with great programmers.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: The use of a program to prove the 4-color theorem will not change mathematics - it merely demonstrates that the theorem, a challenge for a century, is probably not important to mathematics.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: The most important computer is the one that rages in our skulls and ever seeks that satisfactory external emulator. The standarization of real computers would be a disaster - and so it probably won't happen.

- :c: Structured Programming supports the law of the excluded muddle.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: "Re graphics: A picture is worth 10K words - but only those to describe the picture. Hardly any sets of 10K words can be adequately described with pictures."

  :a: Alan J. Perlis

   Giving up on assembly language was the apple in our Garden of Eden: Languages whose use squanders machine cycles are sinful. The LISP machine now permits LISP programmers to abandon bra and fig-leaf.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: When we understand knowledge-based systems, it will be as before -- except our fingertips will have been singed.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: Bringing computers into the home won't change either one, but may revitalize the corner saloon.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: Systems have sub-systems and sub-systems have sub- systems and so on ad infinitum - which is why we're always starting over.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: So many good ideas are never heard from again once they embark in a voyage on the semantic gulf.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: Beware of the Turing tar-pit in which everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: A LISP programmer knows the value of everything, but the cost of nothing.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: In English every word can be verbed. Would that it were so in our programming languages.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: In seeking the unattainable, simplicity only gets in the way.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: In programming, as in everything else, to be in error is to be reborn.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: In computing, invariants are ephemeral.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

   When we write programs that "learn", it turns out that we do and they don't.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: |
   Often it is the means that justify the ends: Goals advance technique and technique survives even when goal structures crumble.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: |
   Make no mistake about it: Computers process numbers - not symbols. We measure our understanding (and control) by the extent to which we can arithmetize an activity.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: Making something variable is easy. Controlling duration of constancy is the trick.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: |
   Think of all the psychic energy expended in seeking a fundamental distinction between "algorithm" and "program".
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: If we believe in data structures, we must believe in independent (hence simultaneous) processing. For why else would we collect items within a structure? Why do we tolerate languages that give us the one without the other?
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: In a 5 year period we get one superb programming language. Only we can't control when the 5 year period will be.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: Over the centuries the Indians developed sign language for communicating phenomena of interest. Programmers from different tribes (FORTRAN, LISP, ALGOL, SNOBOL, etc.) could use one that doesn't require them to carry a blackboard on their ponies.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: "Documentation is like term insurance: It satisfies because almost no one who subscribes to it depends on its benefits."
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: An adequate bootstrap is a contradiction in terms.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: "It is not a language's weakness but its strengths that control the gradient of its change: Alas, a language never escapes its embryonic sac."
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: "Is it possible that software is not like anything else, that it is meant to be discarded: that the whole point is to see it as a soap bubble?"
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: "Because of its vitality, the computing field is always in desperate need of new cliches: Banality soothes our nerves."
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: It is the user who should parameterize procedures, not their creators.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: "The cybernetic exchange between man, computer and algorithm is like a game of musical chairs: The frantic search for balance always leaves one of the three standing ill at ease."
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: If your computer speaks English, it was probably made in Japan.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: "We are on the verge: Today our program proved Fermat's next-to-last theorem."
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: Though the Chinese should adore APL, it's FORTRAN they put their money on.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: We kid ourselves if we think that the ratio of procedure to data in an active data-base system can be made arbitrarily small or even kept small.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: We have the mini and the micro computer. In what semantic niche would the pico computer fall?
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: It is not the computer's fault that Maxwell's equations are not adequate to design the electric motor.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: One does not learn computing by using a hand calculator, but one can forget arithmetic.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: Computation has made the tree flower.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: The computer reminds one of Lon Chaney -- it is the machine of a thousand faces.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: We will never run out of things to program as long as there is a single program around.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: "Dealing with failure is easy: Work hard to improve. Success is also easy to handle: You've solved the wrong problem. Work hard to improve."
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: One can't proceed from the informal to the formal by formal means.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: Purely applicative languages are poorly applicable.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: The proof of a system's value is its existence.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: You think you know when you can learn, are more sure when you can write, even more when you can teach, but certain when you can program.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: It goes against the grain of modern education to teach children to program. What fun is there in making plans, acquiring discipline in organizing thoughts, devoting attention to detail and learning to be self-critical?
