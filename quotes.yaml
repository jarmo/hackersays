  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: The most important computer is the one that rages in our skulls and ever seeks that satisfactory external emulator. The standarization of real computers would be a disaster - and so it probably won't happen.

- :c: Structured Programming supports the law of the excluded muddle.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

   Giving up on assembly language was the apple in our Garden of Eden: Languages whose use squanders machine cycles are sinful. The LISP machine now permits LISP programmers to abandon bra and fig-leaf.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: When we understand knowledge-based systems, it will be as before -- except our fingertips will have been singed.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: Bringing computers into the home won't change either one, but may revitalize the corner saloon.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: A LISP programmer knows the value of everything, but the cost of nothing.

  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: In English every word can be verbed. Would that it were so in our programming languages.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: In seeking the unattainable, simplicity only gets in the way.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: In computing, invariants are ephemeral.

   When we write programs that "learn", it turns out that we do and they don't.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

   Often it is the means that justify the ends: Goals advance technique and technique survives even when goal structures crumble.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: |
   Make no mistake about it: Computers process numbers - not symbols. We measure our understanding (and control) by the extent to which we can arithmetize an activity.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: Making something variable is easy. Controlling duration of constancy is the trick.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: |
   Think of all the psychic energy expended in seeking a fundamental distinction between "algorithm" and "program".
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: If we believe in data structures, we must believe in independent (hence simultaneous) processing. For why else would we collect items within a structure? Why do we tolerate languages that give us the one without the other?
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: In a 5 year period we get one superb programming language. Only we can't control when the 5 year period will be.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: "Documentation is like term insurance: It satisfies because almost no one who subscribes to it depends on its benefits."
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: An adequate bootstrap is a contradiction in terms.
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: "It is not a language's weakness but its strengths that control the gradient of its change: Alas, a language never escapes its embryonic sac."
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: "Is it possible that software is not like anything else, that it is meant to be discarded: that the whole point is to see it as a soap bubble?"
  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: "Because of its vitality, the computing field is always in desperate need of new cliches: Banality soothes our nerves."

  :a: Alan J. Perlis

- :c: We have the mini and the micro computer. In what semantic niche would the pico computer fall?
  :a: Alan J. Perlis
